Enter the computational limits in the x direction, XL, XU: 0 1.0
Enter the numbers of grid intervals of the
	computational grid in the x & y directions: 200
The topological grid is a grid used for the construction of the tracked front
	topology.  It is constrained to be a square grid.  You specify the grid
	in one of two ways.  If you enter a single number, it will be used as a
	coarseness factor for the topological grid relative to the
	computational grid entered above.  In this case the length of a
	topological grid block cell side is the nearest allowable multiple of
	the shortest side of the computational grid by the coarseness factor. 
	Otherwise the code will read the two integers input for the number of
	grid cells in each coordinate direction of the topological grid.  If
	your input values do not yield a square grid they will be corrected to
	produce a square grid.  This correction will attempt to produce values
	close to those input, but if the input values are highly rectangular,
	the resulting values may differ considerably from those entered.  The
	default for this input option is the nearest square grid that matches
	the computational grid.  Generally the topological grid is coarser than
	the computational grid.  Larger coarseness factors yield coarser grids,
	a value one gives the nearest square grid to the computational grid.

Dynamic tracking decision variables
Tracking decisions on dynamically produced waves are based on a floating point
	cutoff on the wave strength.  Strengths are normalized to zero for weak
	waves, so a tolerance of 0.0 will always signal tracking, and a very
	large tolerance will always signal not to track.  For each interaction
	type, you will be asked to enter the cutoff tolerance and a tolerance
	type for determining whether scattered waves of the indicated type
	should be tracked when produced by a specific bifurcation type.
