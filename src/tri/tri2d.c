*
*	The algorithm for inserting grid crossings is taken from
*	merge_with_points_on_mesh_lines() in psgrid.c.  In this
*	algorithm grid_crossings_on_segment() is called for each
*	bond on the interface.  grid_crossings_on_segment() loads
*	the new_intfc_points[] array with the points to be inserted.
*	Then the insert_point_in_bond() is called to insert these
*	new points in grid_intfc.  The state associated with a new
*	point is expected to be calculated by USER_insert_point_in_bond,
*	presumably by interpolation along the bond.

/*
*	Remark about tolerences in insert_grid_crossings2d().
*
*		The shifting of points on the interface to positions
*	at least some minimum distance from certain grid lines
*	has the potential of producing new tangles in the
*	hyp trigrid interface.  This problem can be expected
*	to occur when a node occupies a position that corresponds
*	to a corner of the dual lattice.  Since human nature
*	tends to think in terms of whole numbers,  it is
*	quite likely that stationary nodes such as sources and
*	sinks will be put in such locations.  In particular
*	runs that are being compared with finite difference
*	methods can be expected to have this property since
*	the wells will be placed at the centers of the computational
*	lattice and hence at the corners of the dual lattice.
*
*		An example occurs when a sink node with two curves
*	lies at a corner.  The node is shifted away from the
*	corner for the purposes of the component and triangulation
*	computation.  This shift causes the resulting grid crossing
*	of one of these curves to move out of the neighborhood of
*	of the nearest orthogonal grid line,  while the other curve 
*	crosses the same grid line as the first but lies inside this 
*	neighborhood.  This second point is then shifted by the tolerence
*	TOL*[hx or hy] to move it away from the corner of the grid
*	block,  but this shift can it past the other
*	crossing producing a new tangle.
*
*		Ideally,  the solution to this problem is to have
*	no (zero) tolerences,  but this will likely cause floating
*	problems and difficulties in ordering the grid crossings
*	around the grid blocks,  since it is possible for the
*	crossings to occur at corners (for example a 45 degree
*	Neumann boundary on a square mesh).   This problem can
*	be reduced by lowering the tolerences and requiring
*	that nodes be further shifted into the grid blocks than
*	regular grid crossings.  Other resolutions to this problem
*	will require complicated logic in order to detect and eliminate
*	(or never produce) these tangles.
