Enter the computational limits in the z direction, ZL, ZU: 0 20 
Enter the Numbers of Grid Intervals of the
	Computational grid in the x, y, & z directions: 336 112 896 
The topological grid is a grid used for the construction of the tracked front
	topology.  It is constrained to be a square grid.  You specify the grid
	in one of two ways.  If you enter a single number,  it will be used as
	a coarseness factor for the topological grid relative to the 
	computational grid entered above.  In this case the length of a
	topological grid block cell side is the nearest allowable multiple of
	the shortest side of the computational grid by the coarseness factor.
	Otherwise the code will read the three integers input for the number
	of grid cells in each coordinate direction of the topological grid.
	If your input values do not yield a square grid they will be corrected
	to produce a square grid.  This correction will attempt to produce
	values close to those input, but if the input values are highly 
	rectangular, the resulting values may differ considerably
	from those entered.  The default for this input option is the nearest
	square grid that matches the computational grid.  Generally the
	topological grid is coarser than the computational grid.  Larger
	coarseness factors yield coarser grids,  a value one gives the
	nearest square grid to the computational grid.
Enter your choice (cor_fac, three integers, or return)
