Liquid code is an incompressible code, still under development.
The current version is for 2D only. To compile the code, the FronTier
must be configured with PETSc, linpak and blas and openmpi. An additional 
option is to link with HDF which will produce 2D hdf movies on component,
vorticity, pressure, x, and y velocities.

For example, to compile on galaxy:

configure --with-gas --with-hdf=/usr/local/pkg/HDF4 --with-openmpi=/usr/local/pkg/openmpi --with-petsc=/usr/local/pkg/petsc-2.3.3/petsc-2.3.3-p11 --with-devel

First make the FronTier library under FronTier directory, and then
cd liquid
make

Five sample input files are provided:

in-drop
in-bubble
in-rt
in-turbulence
in-laminar

Command line must include dimension, for example:

mpirun -np 1 liquid -d 2 -p 1 1 -i input-name -o output-name

Restart the run from step t:

mpirun -np 1 liquid -d 2 -p 1 1 -i input-name -o output-name -r restart-name -t step
