This directory contains code (wave.cpp) for testing of one dimensional 
numerical schemes of wave equation:

	u_t + a*u_x = 0.

The schemes include:

Upwind			(input file: in-uw, conditionally stable)
Lax-Friedrich		(input file: in-lf, conditionally stable)
Lax-Wendroff		(input file: in-lw, conditionally stable)
MacCormack		(input file: in-mac, conditionally stable)
Central-explicit	(input file: in-cex, unconditionally unstable)
Central-implicit	(input file: in-cim, unconditionally stable)
Crank-Nicolson		(input file: in-cn, unconditionally stable).

It also contains code (heat.cpp) for testing of one dimensional numerical
schemes for heat equation:

	u_t = bu_xx.

The schemes include:

Central-explicit	(input file: in-heat-cex, conditionally unstable)
Central-implicit	(input file: in-heat-cim, unconditionally stable)
Crank-Nicolson		(input file: in-heat-cn, unconditionally stable).

To compile and run code in this directory, FronTier must be configured with
inclusion of the GD library:

configure --with-gd=/usr/local/pkg/gd --with-devel

To compile wave.cpp:

make wave

To run wave:

wave -d 1 -i input-name -o output-name

To compile heat.cpp:

make heat

To run heat:

heat -d 1 -i input-name -o output-name
